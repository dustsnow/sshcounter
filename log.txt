After I added the device search code, it cannot connect to deive anymore
The reason is I comment out the block of errno == EINPROGRESS, and also the socket is set to non-blocking. Connect() function call on a non-blocking socket will return -1 immediately. That why it doesn't work. It has nothing to do with device search code
