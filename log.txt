After I added the device search code, it cannot connect to deive anymore
The reason is I comment out the block of errno == EINPROGRESS, and also the socket is set to non-blocking. Connect() function call on a non-blocking socket will return -1 immediately. That why it doesn't work. It has nothing to do with device search code

Now, it's able to connect to the device whenever it plugin(Hot plugin pullout capability)
Next step:
	config file. daemon read configuration from config file
	startup script. be able to start, stop, restart service
Later:
	Abstract bluetooth connection functionality to a daemon. Other daemon can utility this daemon to transfer data.
